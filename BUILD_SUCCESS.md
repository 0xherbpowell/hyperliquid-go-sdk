# Hyperliquid Go SDK - Build Success ✅

## Status
All build issues have been resolved! The SDK and all examples now compile and run successfully.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Build Conflicts Resolved
- ❌ **Problem**: Multiple `main` functions in the same package causing build conflicts
- ✅ **Solution**: Examples are now built individually with `example_utils.go`

### 2. Missing Dependencies Added
- ❌ **Problem**: Examples used non-existent SDK functions
- ✅ **Solution**: Added missing helper functions and removed examples that required unimplemented features

### 3. Import Issues Fixed
- ❌ **Problem**: Unused imports and redeclared constants
- ✅ **Solution**: Cleaned up imports and removed duplicate declarations

## Current Working Examples (14 total)

### ✅ All Examples Build Successfully

## How to Use

### Method 1: Run Individual Examples
```bash
# Using the run script
./examples/run_example.sh basic_order

# Or directly with go run
go run examples/basic_order.go examples/example_utils.go
```

### Method 2: Build and Run
```bash
# Build specific example
go build -o basic_order examples/basic_order.go examples/example_utils.go

# Run the executable
./basic_order
```

### Method 3: Test All Examples
```bash
# Test that all examples compile
./examples/test_all.sh
```

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
export HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS="your_address_here"  # Optional
```

### Config File (Alternative)
Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill in your credentials:
```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_private_key_here_without_0x_prefix",
  "account_address": "your_ethereum_address_here"
}
```

## Added Features

### Helper Functions
- `CreateRandomWallet()` - Generate random wallets for testing
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Proper cleanup of test orders

### Build Scripts
- `examples/run_example.sh` - Run individual examples
- `examples/test_all.sh` - Test building all examples
- `config.json.example` - Sample configuration

### Documentation
- Updated README with clear instructions
- Build success verification
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Structure**: Each example can be run independently
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with clear error messages
3. **Safety Features**: Testnet by default, order cleanup
4. **Testing**: Automated build testing for all examples
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

## SDK Features Demonstrated

- **Trading Operations**: Limit orders, market orders, cancellations
- **Order Management**: Modifications, client IDs, bulk operations
- **Account Management**: User state, positions, balances
- **Transfer Operations**: USD transfers, spot transfers, withdrawals
- **Advanced Features**: Leverage adjustment, TP/SL orders
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket streaming
- **Agent Concepts**: Sub-account and delegation patterns

## Build Verification

The SDK now passes all build tests:
- ✅ All 14 examples compile successfully
- ✅ Main SDK packages build without errors
- ✅ No import conflicts or unused dependencies
- ✅ Examples run and fail gracefully without credentials
- ✅ Clear error messages for missing configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Add Credentials**: Set up your private key and address
2. **Get Testnet Funds**: Visit Hyperliquid testnet for test funds
3. **Run Examples**: Start with `basic_order.go` or `basic_trading.go`
4. **Explore Features**: Try different examples to learn the SDK
5. **Build Your App**: Use examples as templates for your application
